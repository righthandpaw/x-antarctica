#TERRAIN PROMOTION TABLE!
#
# This table describes how adjacent terrain "promotes" terrain that is nearby.  This is used to "spread"
# high-interest terrain in different ways.  Adjacent is the value of the highest-terrain'd nearby terrain.
# US is the terrain being acted on, and result is waht US becomes.  So any natural terrain that is next to
# mixed farm will become mixed farm.
#
# Currently this formula is applied exactly once during zoning.
