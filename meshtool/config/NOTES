	Added a new spreadsheet column, "URBAN-SQUARE".
	This requires the nearest urban to be square, irregular.  Values are:
		0 = don't care
		1 = reguire square
		2 = require irregular
	
	This can be used to determine the city type (square vs irregular) for
	mesh that is not over an urban land use, but near one.

	A new raster layer dem_UrbanSquare holds this info.

	Fixed color export - it now uses enum_color.txt
	
	Added a preference to relate the temperature data to a certain altitude.
	(It used to be that temperature was always tied to the 50% altitudes of a XES.)
	
	A new raster layer dem_TemperatureSeaLevel shows the temperature at sea level
	for a XES, which shows climate change without mountains.
	
	Change to enu_colors.txt: the COLOR_ENUM_DEM command is needed to indicate
	which raster layers are enumerated
